## Introduction

This project consisted of finding a problem to solve in my work or social life. I choose to focus on work and found that although there are career guides with competencies, it can take some time to work out what competencies you have and what roles they map to.  

My solution essentially puts the career guide into an interactive website, making it simple to track competencies achieved and find out what career level you are based on the competencies and what you need to do to reach the next level.  

The solution is to be used as a tool to prompt career discussions with managers as employees may not be at their correct career level and missing out on compensation/promotions. Being an apprentice, I am keen to keep progressing and the result of this project allows me to clearly see my progression path. 

This application isnâ€™t required by my organisation however has the possibility to be used by them. The current data in the database is not directly related to my company due to the approval needed, however it does show the proof of concept.

## System Overview

A high-level overview of how the system functions, you can use screen shots if it helps. You should consider aspects such as:

-   Briefly describing all datastores including databases, file systems and media data stores
-   Key views and interfaces
-   Including a diagram of the key system components and how they are linked

## Key Design Decisions

You should rationalise the choices you made in designing your application. This section could be broken down into the following sections:

### Database Design

This section will document the different database entities and how they are related.

### Security and Scalability

Identify in what ways your application is secure and scalable.
